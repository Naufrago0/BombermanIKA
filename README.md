# BombermanIKA
3D Bomberman game made with Unreal 4

## Next Steps:

* Improve algorithm to generate the random levels, now there's chance to take more time and processing then it's needed. My soultion will be to create an array with all block coordinates that can contain a destroyable block and choose them randomly and extracting the selected ones from the array. This will guarantee as much iterations as the number of configured destroyable blocks.
* Adding enemies controlled by AI will be great, my first idea to implement them in short time will be to move them block to block checking the adjacents blocks and take a decision, this is limited as the enemies see very small of the whole level. A improvement will be to make them see the whole level and take more complex decisions.

## Time Taken:

15 Hours.

## Game Build:

Game Build is distributed in a chunked zip: [Part1](Build.zip.001) [Part2](Build.zip.002) [Part3](Build.zip.003)

Project source is in this other zip file: [Project Sources](BombermanIKAProject.zip)
